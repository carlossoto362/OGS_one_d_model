        >>>import numpy
        >>>s_e = numpy.load('s_e.npy')

s_a.npy is the a_priori covariance matrix (computed with the output of the maximun likelihood aproach). 
x_a.npy is the a_priori mean vector (computed with the output of the maximun likelihood aproach).

x_a is a vector representing chla, nap, cdom.
