Within the New Copernicus Capability for Trophic Ocean Networks (NECCTON) project,
 we aim to improve the current data assimilation system by developing a method for accurately
 estimating marine optical constituents from satellite derived Remote Sensing Reflectance.

 In the next modules, we present a functional version of the codes used for the project.
 The complete code can be found in https://github.com/carlossoto362/OGS_one_d_model.

The make file has being tested only in a computer with Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS bulsay, with
python3 and pip3 installed. It creates a virtual environment for python3, and a variable
for the home page. If make doesn't work, the python3 libraries for which the
codes have been tested are in requirements.txt. Also, you need to add the PySurfaceData to the
python path, one option would be running $python3 -c 'import sys; sys.path.insert(1, "./PySurfaceData")'.
Finally, some modules require the home path added as a local variable, for example, run
"export OGS_ONE_D_HOME_PATH=$(PWD)".
